# TWRP for Samsung A03 Core

Took me 3-4 hours, Download the file [here](https://github.com/XanderFromFortnite/Twrp_a30core/releases).

Click [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/how-to-convert-img-to-tar-md5-with-ease-with-odin3.2833350/) to make it work with odin.
If you dont know what's odin, what are you doing here?
