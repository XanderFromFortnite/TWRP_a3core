**NOTE: I NEED HELP WITH `twrp.flags & recovery.fstab` [(File Here)](https://github.com/XanderFromFortnite/TWRP_a3core/tree/main/ramdisk/system/etc), I have tried everything and no matter what I do, if I mount /system, I cant wipe it, and no wipe /system = no gsi**

### Please, go over to this [Issue](https://github.com/XanderFromFortnite/TWRP_a3core/issues/3) and tell us if you have fixed `twrp.flags & recovery.fstab`
