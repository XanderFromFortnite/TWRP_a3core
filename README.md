### Special Notes

- Currently, decryption on 12.1 is a work in progress (WIP). Decryption is only fully functional (i.e. works with password/PIN/pattern) on legacy Pixel devices that use weaver but do not use wrappedkey. On other devices, decryption will only work if no password/PIN/pattern is set in Android.
