# TWRP for Samsung A03 Core

Took me 1-2 hours to build .img on my device, Download the file [here](https://github.com/XanderFromFortnite/Twrp_a30core/releases) btw.

if you have a low end computer and can't build twrp, use [Gitpot](https://gitpod.io/)

Oh, A note for the noobs:
If you dont know what's odin, what are you doing here?
